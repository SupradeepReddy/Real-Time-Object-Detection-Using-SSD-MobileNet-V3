# Real-Time-Object-Detection-Using-SSD-MobileNet-V3
The project "Real-Time Object Detection using SSD-MobileNet V3" implements a lightweight and efficient deep learning model to detect and classify objects in live video streams. It combines the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) with the MobileNet V3 backbone for fast and accurate performance on edge devices.
